# Contributing to Arch Dependency Matrix Analysis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this mathematical research project!

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have a suggestion? Please open an issue with:
- Clear description of the problem/suggestion
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- System information (OS, Python version, package count)

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-analysis`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests if applicable
5. Update documentation
6. Commit with descriptive messages
7. Push to your fork
8. Open a pull request

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Document functions with docstrings
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add methodology documentation for new analyses
- Include mathematical formulas in LaTeX notation
- Provide examples and use cases

### Testing

- Verify calculations with known test cases
- Check matrix properties (symmetry, dimensions, etc.)
- Validate against mathematical theorems
- Test on different package counts

## Areas for Contribution

### Priority Areas

1. **Visualization** - Create graphs and charts of results
2. **Performance** - Optimize matrix operations for larger systems
3. **Cross-Platform** - Adapt for non-Arch package managers
4. **Analysis** - Add new mathematical metrics

### Ideas Welcome

- Version conflict analysis (not just binary compatibility)
- Temporal analysis (how dependencies change over time)
- Predictive modeling (future conflict probability)
- Interactive visualizations
- Command-line tool interface
